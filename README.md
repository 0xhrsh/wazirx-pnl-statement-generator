Wazirx only generates trading reports and not profix and loss statement. pnl statements are necessary for filing ITR.

- Download all trading report and save them in data directory (inside the project).
- Use `pro_process.py` file to extract Exchange Trades and P2P trades into separate csv files.
- Use `pnl.py` to generate a profit and loss statement from Exchange and P2P trade csv files.
- Verify with your CA before using this for filing your ITR. This application is vibecoded, so it is not guaranteed to work.
